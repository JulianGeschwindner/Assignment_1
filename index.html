    <center><h2>My journey about web design and programming </h2></center>
    <br>

    <p>This is my first trial of designing a web page.

    </p> <i>I am trying out diffrent fonts</i> and how to make text <strong>appear as very important!</strong>
    <br>
    <p>There are so many elements to web design and I know that this here is just the beginning.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am looking forward to learn more skills and to be ale to create beautiful pages with images and colors and so many other elements!</p>
    <br>
    <p>For this is it and I look forward to the next lesson!</p>
